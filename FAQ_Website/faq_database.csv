Do employers look for an advanced ML degree? ,"For more senior roles: People typically look for practical experience for several years or a specialized degree with some experience. Employers typically want folks who have seen various kinds of ML problems and solved them  who can come up with the right solution for a new problem when they are looking for a more senior role.

For a beginner role: a degree usually adds some level of credibility  but if one has a good portfolio with good projects  it is usually an accepted substitute. Employers do hope to see if the candidate is comfortable with basic concepts in ML along with being able to write code.    "
How does a typical day of a data scientist look like?,"Here are some tasks in the typical day of a data scientist:

Make a plan for the day 
Look at data  what clean up is required  figure out what models can be built
Talk to various stakeholders about what modeling is possible and help them narrow down to something useful for the business
Build models  test and debug (takes a long time)
Parameter tuning ? test tons and tons of parameters (takes a long time)
Come up with prod architecture to get deployment ready
Write ML pipeline for production ready modeles ? deploy them
Wait for long time till we have a significant sample to see if they are working
Analyze and see whether the models are working as expected  have any impact
Come up with improvements/ corrections based on prod feedback and prepare for next iteration.
Meeting with team members / daily sprints / bug triages based on production feedback ? Interaction with ML Manager  Product Manager  Developers  Data engineers"
Do I need to prepare algorithms and data structures for a data science interview ? ,"Yes. In many data science interviews (ML Scientist  data scientist  ML Engineer  Data engineer) there is a coding round and an algorithms round. So preparing algorithms and data structures is necessary. Some of the Analyst interviews  such as a data analyst and a business analyst might not have an algorithms and data structures round. 
"
How proficient should a data scientist be in coding? ,"Needs to be reasonably proficient. Again  a data scientist is a developer ++. Usually expected to have the basic skills a developer has including understanding algorithms and data structures and being able to write clean  understable  efficient  well documented code. 

In many cases  the data scientist is expected to write production ready code and be able to understand the deployment process. In some cases  the coding could be for decision support."
What is the mathematical background required for a data scientist ?,"The following three are the basic building blocks in terms of data science math background: Linear Algebra  Probability and Statistics and Calculus and optimization.
"
What are the various rounds in a data scientist interview ? ,"Usually the data science interview has a subset of these rounds. 

Resume deep dive
ML Concepts
ML Scenario and Problem solving
Algorithms and data structures
Coding
Behavioural
Sometimes  some of these rounds might be combined  for instance there might not be two separate rounds for coding and algorithms. Similarly there might be a single round for ML concepts and scenario based problem solving."
Why data cleansing is important?,"Data cleansing is a process in which you go through all of the data within a database and either remove or update information that is incomplete, incorrect, improperly formatted, duplicated, or irrelevant. It usually involves cleaning up data compiled in one area. For individuals, data cleansing is important because it ensures Data cleansing usually involves cleaning up data compiled in one area. In the case of an organisation, data cleansing is important because it improves your data quality and in doing so, increases overall productivity."
What is Linear and Logistic Regression?,"The linear regression method involves continuous dependent variable and contains only one independent variable in case of Simple Linear Regression and multiple independent variables in case of Multiple Linear Regression. Here, the outcome (dependent variable) is continuous and can have any one of an infinite number of possible values. Linear regression gives an equation which is of the form Y = mX + C, means equation with degree 1 and this method is used when your response variable is continuous. For instance, weight, height, number of hours, etc. While in logistic regression, the outcome (dependent variable) has only a limited number of possible values. Logistic regression is used when the response variable is categorical in nature. For instance, yes/no, true/false, red/green/blue, etc."
What is Normal Distribution?,"The Normal Distribution is a very common distribution and in the statistical term, it is known as Gaussian distribution. A normal distribution has the following characteristics such as the mean, median and mode of the distribution coincide, the curve of the distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical about the line x=μ, the total area under the curve is 1 and exactly half of the values are to the left of the center and the other half to the right."
Difference between Interpolation and Extrapolation,Extrapolation and interpolation are both used to estimate hypothetical values for a variable based on other observations. Interpolation is an estimation of a value within two known values in a sequence of values and Extrapolation is an estimation of a value based on extending a known sequence of values or facts beyond the area that is certainly known.
What is a recommender system?,Recommender systems are one of the most widely spread applications of machine learning technologies in organisations. This system helps a user to interact with many items. The machine learning algorithms in recommender systems are typically classified into two categories —content-based and collaborative filtering methods although modern recommenders combine both approaches. Content-based methods are based on the similarity of item attributes and collaborative methods calculate similarity from interactions.
"Between R and Python, Which one would you choose for text analysis?","Between R and Python, Python would be the best choice as it has Pandas library which provides high-performance data analysis tools and easy to use data structures. However, you can go with either of these languages depending on the complexity of the data which is being analysed."
Explain A/B Testing,"A/B testing is a statistical method of comparing two or more versions in order to determine which version works better and also understands if the difference between the two or more versions is statistically significant. It is a powerful tool for product development. In technical terms, A/B test is used to refer to any number of experiments where random assignment is used to tease out a causal relationship between treatment, typically some change to a website, and an outcome, often a metric that the business is interested in changing."
How can data scientists increase their salaries?,"To increase your salary as a data scientist, consider the following options:

Change of industry: Consider changing to an industry that is more competitive and willing to pay higher salaries. Social networking companies like Google and Facebook often pay premium salaries for data scientists, as do financial organizations or manufacturers.
Higher education: Data scientists who obtain a doctoral degree are generally able to qualify for more advanced positions and higher salaries.
Leadership roles: Senior data scientists oversee junior data scientists in addition to their regular responsibilities."
Can data scientists work from home?,"Covid-19 has prompted many companies to adopt remote working practices. As such, working from home is technically possible for data scientists at this time. Following the pandemic, companies may opt to retain their work from home policies in order to provide flexibility for their workforce."
Is a data scientist considered an in demand occupation?,"According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, data scientists fall under the larger category of computer and information research scientists. Employment for these professionals is projected to grow 16 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations.
